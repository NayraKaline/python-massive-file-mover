### Recommended for experiments with no longer than 10 folders of datasets
The code has a little bug of move folders from the selected path to the next folder (example, 'cats' folder to the 'dogs' dataset). Because of this, I don't recommend more than 10 datasets

###### Code tested and running on Xubuntu Linux. You can test on other distros or OS and open a pull request or issue for solving some bugs.
